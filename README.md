# MJML-Haml

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/fnix/mjml-haml.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/fnix/mjml-haml) [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/mjml-rails.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/mjml-rails)

**MJML-Haml** allows you to render HTML e-mails from an [MJML](https://mjml.io) template.

An example template might look like:

```haml
/ ./app/views/user_mailer/email.mjml
%mjml
  %mj-body
    %mj-container
      %mj-section
        %mj-column
          %mj-text
          = render :partial => 'info', :formats => [:html]
```

And the partial `_info.mjml`:

```haml
/ ./app/views/user_mailer/_info.mjml
%mj-text= "This is #{@user.username}"
```

* Notice you can use Haml and partials inside the template.

Your `user_mailer.rb` might look like this::

```ruby
# ./app/mailers/user_mailer.rb
class UserMailer < ActionMailer::Base
  def user_signup_confirmation()
    mail(to: 'test@example.com', subject: 'test') do |format|
      format.text
      format.mjml
    end
  end
end
```

## Installation

Add it to your Gemfile.

```ruby
gem 'mjml-haml'
```

Run the following command to install it:

```console
bundle install
```

Install the MJML parser (optional -g to install it globally):

```console
npm install -g mjml@^2.0
```

## Sending Devise user emails

If you use [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) for user authentication and want to send user emails with MJML templates, here's how to override the [devise mailer](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/blob/master/app/mailers/devise/mailer.rb):
```ruby
# app/mailers/devise_mailer.rb
class DeviseMailer < Devise::Mailer
  def reset_password_instructions(record, token, opts={})
    @token = token
    @resource = record
    # Custom logic to send the email with MJML
    mail(
      template_path: 'devise/mailer',
      from: "some@email.com", 
      to: record.email, 
      subject: "Custom subject"
    ) do |format|
      format.mjml
      format.text
    end
  end
end
```

Now tell devise to user your mailer in `config/initializers/devise.rb` by setting `config.mailer = 'DeviseMailer'` or whatever name you called yours.

And then your MJML template goes here: `app/views/devise/mailer/reset_password_instructions.mjml`

Devise also have [more instructions](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/wiki/How-To:-Use-custom-mailer) if you need them.

## Deploying with Heroku

To deploy with [Heroku](https://heroku.com) you'll need to setup [multiple buildpacks](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/using-multiple-buildpacks-for-an-app) so that Heroku first builds Node for MJML and then the Ruby environment for your app.

Once you've installed the [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/) you can setup the buildpacks from the commandline:

`$ heroku buildpacks:set heroku/ruby`

And then add the Node buildpack to index 1 so it's run first:

`$ heroku buildpacks:add --index 1 heroku/nodejs`

Check that's all setup by running:

`$ heroku buildpacks`

Next you'll need to setup a `package.json` file in the root, something like this:

```json
{
  "name": "your-site",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Now with MJML email templates!",
  "main": "index.js",
  "directories": {
    "doc": "doc",
    "test": "test"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "mjml": "^2.0"
  },
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "git+https://github.com/your-repo/your-site.git"
  },
  "keywords": [
    "mailer"
  ],
  "author": "Your Name",
  "license": "ISC",
  "bugs": {
    "url": "https://github.com/fnix/mjml-haml/issues"
  },
  "homepage": "https://github.com/fnix/mjml-haml"
}
```

Then `$ git push heroku master` and it should Just WorkTM.
